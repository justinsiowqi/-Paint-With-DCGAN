Ever wanted to leverage the power of code to bring paintings to life? 

Introducing the **Generative Adversarial Network** (GAN). It's a powerful neural network that creates new, realistic images just from learning from some examples. Specifically, we'll focus on creating a **Deep Convolutional GAN** (DCGAN) to create monet-esque paintings from scratch. 

Get your paint brushes ready as we learn from the legendary Claude Monet...
